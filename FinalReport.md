## Project Title: 
Using AI Hardware Acceleration to Detect Real-Time Crowd and Traffic Conditions

## Key Objective:
- Crowd Density Detection: Develop a robust computer vision model using Hailo 8 on Raspberry Pi to detect crowd density in real-time and categorize it into different levels (e.g., low, medium, high) based on traffic patterns along Engineer's Way.
- Energy Efficiency and Processing Optimization: Leverage the hardware acceleration provided by Hailo 8 to ensure the system runs efficiently, with low latency, minimal energy consumption, and optimized processing for real-time applications.
- Scalability and Deployment Strategy: Design a scalable solution that can easily be deployed across multiple pathways or locations on campus, providing consistent and accurate data on foot traffic.

## Technology Stack
- Hardware: Raspberry Pi, Hailo 8 AI processor, Pixy2 camera
- Software: Python, OpenCV, TensorFlow Lite, Hailo SDK
