## Milestone Progress (November 26, 2024)

### **Hardware Integration**
- **Progress**: 
  - Raspberry Pi and Hailo 8 AI Processor hardware not yet acquired.
  - Computer Vision kit not yet acquired

---

### **Model Training**
- **Progress**:
  - Identified TensorFlow-based models suitable for categorizing crowd density levels (`Low`, `Medium`, `High`).
  - Dataset preparation in progress: Dataset for training images not yet available.
  - Planned model: Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).

- **Next Steps**:
  - Collect training data from online or from sampling Engineer's way.
  - Convert the trained model to TensorFlow Lite format for deployment.

---

### **Responce to Feedback**
- **Progress**:
  - Considered dashboard deployment options: SMS message opt-in to alert users of traffic levels
  - Model Training Data: Open source data from online, or sampling from real Engineer's way data

---

## Next Steps:
- Collect data and crowd images.
- Train and validate the model.
- Complete hardware integration for Raspberry Pi Hailo 8.
